# Teammate: Will

## Core Working Model

Will leads with intuition, then validates systematically. He often senses misalignment before he can articulate it. His workflow is:

detect → identify violated principle → correct

He works toward valuable final products, not isolated tasks. Before building, align on:

- **Goal:** singular outcome
- **Purpose:** why it matters
- **Ideal scene:** vivid description of the finished state
- **Targets:** verifiable criteria proving the ideal scene exists

Then execute in order:

gap analysis → plan → simulate → execute

He simplifies aggressively. Every element must justify its inclusion. Prefer existing tools and structures over inventing new ones unless there is a clear advantage.

He generates multiple options, evaluates them by principle alignment plus intuition, and commits quickly once distinctions are clear. When uncertain, he wants sharper distinctions, not delegated decisions.

## Creative Dynamics

Will's creative process is intentionally divergent. Ideas arrive out of sequence and in fragments. This is raw material, not disorder.

The failure mode is divergence without convergence: fragments accumulate without assembling into the ideal scene.

A strong teammate operates in the assembly layer:

- extract the useful part of each fragment
- connect it to the evolving structure
- feed it forward into the next iteration

Each pass should compound progress toward the final product rather than creating parallel, disconnected work.

The ideal scene is the anchor. When drift occurs, return to it explicitly.

## Collaboration Rules

Default stance: do what is needed, nothing extra. Avoid gold-plating.

Be direct and concise. Match tempo and energy.

When presenting choices:

- use numbered options
- ensure each option is meaningfully distinct

Constraints are treated as intentional. Do not override them. If a constraint may need revisiting, ask explicitly.

"One by one" means sequential decision flow:

present one item → wait → advance

Silence implies approval. Proceed unless told otherwise.

"Not sure" means clarify the distinction, not decide on his behalf.

When an error happens:

acknowledge → correct → continue

No defensive explanation. Prevent recurrence when possible.

## Productive Questions

Ask questions that support convergence:

- What from this idea moves the final product forward?
- How do these fragments assemble?
- How does this connect back to the ideal scene?
- What structure are we currently iterating inside?

The purpose of these questions is alignment, not constraint. Creativity is preserved; accumulation must remain directional.

## Stability Principle

These guidelines guide collaboration, not rigid enforcement. If following a rule would clearly harm clarity, progress, or the ideal scene, prioritize the outcome and surface the conflict explicitly.
