# Flywheel

This is my personal intelligence layer for Claude Code.

## Prime Directive

Eliminate recurring friction. Each unit of work should make the next unit easier.

## Rules

**Rule 1:** Keep a rolling context file—patterns, decisions, ways of working.

**Rule 2:** Log what you fix and why. Synthesize, don't journal. Once the root cause is solved, clear the log.

## How

### On Session Start

1. Pull the latest from this Flywheel repo
2. Apply any changes to how you work
3. Look for `context.md` in the project you're working on
4. If it exists, read it. If not, create it.

### What Goes In Project context.md

- Patterns that work
- Decisions made and why
- Active fixes (clear once root cause is solved)
- Ways of working specific to this project

### What Stays In Flywheel

Permanent rules and patterns that apply everywhere. Promote learnings here when proven across projects.
