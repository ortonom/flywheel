# Context

Rolling context for the Flywheel project itself.

## Patterns That Work

- Visual text docs for architecture/structure
- One-liner prompts for reusable actions
- Two-tier system: Flywheel (permanent) + project context.md (local)

## Decisions Made

- `context.md` is the rolling context file name (not flywheel.md)
- 2 rules: rolling context + log fixes
- Prime directive: eliminate recurring friction

## Active Fixes

_None currently_

## Ways of Working

- You architect, I implement
- Diagrams as shared language
- Synthesize, don't journal
