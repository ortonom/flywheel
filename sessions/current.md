## Recent Activity
- Initial Flywheel system created
- Established conventions, prompts, and learnings structure
- Set up session continuity workflow

## Current Focus
Getting familiar with the Flywheel system and adapting it to your workflow.

## Active Projects
_None yet - add projects as you work on them_

## Next Steps
1. Try the Flywheel in a real project
2. Adjust conventions based on what feels right
3. Add learnings as you discover them

## Open Items
- Customize conventions to match your actual preferences
- Add project-specific prompts as needed
- Build up the learnings library over time

## Notes
This is a fresh start. The structure is here - now it needs to be filled with your actual patterns and knowledge.
