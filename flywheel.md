# Flywheel - Rolling Context

## Current State

Building the Flywheel system itself.

## Patterns Emerging

- Visual text docs for architecture/structure
- One-liner prompts for reusable actions
- Two-tier system: base flywheel (read-only) + project flywheel (local context)

## Themes

- Simplicity over comprehensiveness
- Rules that compound over time
- Bridge between human architect and Claude executor

## Ways of Working

- You architect, I implement
- Diagrams as shared language
- Same problem twice → stop and solve properly
