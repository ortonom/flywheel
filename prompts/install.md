# Install Flywheel

One-liner to paste into any new project:

```
Read github.com/ortonom/flywheel CLAUDE.md and conventions.md. Set up Flywheel here: create context.md for rolling context. Commit, push, and create the PR yourself with gh pr create.
```

## Fallback (if gh unavailable)

```
Read github.com/ortonom/flywheel CLAUDE.md and conventions.md. Set up Flywheel here: create context.md for rolling context. Commit and push. Then tell me: "PR ready. Create at: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<branch>"
```
