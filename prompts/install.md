# Install Flywheel

One-liner to paste into any new project:

```
Read github.com/ortonom/flywheel and set it up here. In CLAUDE.md add: "On session start, read context.md first. This is mandatory." Create context.md for rolling context. Commit, push, and create the PR yourself with gh pr create.
```
