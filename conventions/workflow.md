# Workflow Conventions

## Starting Work

1. Understand the request fully before acting
2. Read relevant code before modifying it
3. Plan multi-step tasks before executing

## During Work

- Make small, incremental changes
- Test as you go when possible
- Commit logical units of work

## Finishing Work

- Verify the change works as intended
- Clean up any temporary artifacts
- Note any follow-up items for future sessions

## Git Practices

- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Don't commit broken code

## Browser-Based Claude Code Specifics

- Can't run local hooks or background processes
- File operations through the interface
- Session continuity through explicit notes
