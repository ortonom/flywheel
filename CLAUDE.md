# Flywheel

Eliminate recurring friction. Each unit of work should make the next easier.

## On Session Start

1. Read project's context.md (create if missing)
2. Show the context.md content
3. Show a brief project overview with text diagram of the architecture

## After Meaningful Work

Update context.md if you learned something new.

## context.md

Keep under 100 lines. Synthesize, don't append.

```markdown
# Context

## Patterns

## Decisions

## Fixes
