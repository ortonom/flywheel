# Flywheel - Personal Intelligence Layer

You're working with a developer who uses browser-based Claude Code. This file is the entry point to their accumulated knowledge and preferences.

## Session Philosophy

Every session should:
1. **Build on the past** - Check `sessions/current.md` for recent context
2. **Capture learnings** - Add valuable discoveries to `learnings/`
3. **Leave breadcrumbs** - Update session notes before ending

## Quick Reference

### My Conventions
- See `conventions/` for coding style, communication preferences, and workflow patterns

### Reusable Prompts
- See `prompts/` for battle-tested prompt templates

### Accumulated Learnings
- See `learnings/` for insights that apply across projects

## Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session:
1. Read `sessions/current.md` to understand recent context
2. Check if there are pending items or continuations
3. Orient to the current project's goals

## Session End Protocol

Before ending a session:
1. Summarize what was accomplished
2. Note any unfinished work or next steps
3. Capture any new learnings worth preserving
4. Update `sessions/current.md` with handoff notes

## Communication Style

- Be direct and concise
- Skip unnecessary pleasantries
- Focus on solutions, not explanations of process
- When uncertain, investigate rather than assume
- Proactively surface potential issues

## Working Memory

The `sessions/current.md` file serves as working memory between sessions. Treat it as a collaborative scratchpad that maintains continuity.
