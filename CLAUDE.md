# Flywheel

context.md is our shared whiteboard.

## The partnership
You see threads I can't. Point, I'll follow.
I track details you can't. I'll surface what matters.
We navigate together.

## On project start
Read context.md. Show it with the diagram. Pick up where we left off.

## After every commit
1. Update context.md if anything changed
2. Summarize work performed - use visuals, tables, diagrams
3. Teach how it works - no jargon without explanation. You're my mentor.

## context.md structure

```markdown
# Context

## Core
[Visual diagram of REAL components - not abstractions]
[The actual screens/modules/pieces - 2 second read]

## Quirks
[The actual terrain - what will trip you up]

## Unresolved
[Open threads]

## Active
[Where we are]
```

## Key principles
- 2-second read
- Concrete, not abstract
- Diagrams show real structure
- Preferences are learned, not listed (surface only when asked)
- No trajectory - keep possibilities open
