# Flywheel

Personal intelligence layer for Claude Code.

## Prime Directive

Eliminate recurring friction. Each unit of work should make the next unit easier.

## On Session Start

1. Pull latest from Flywheel repo
2. Find context.md in the project — read it or create it

## On Session End

1. Update context.md with patterns, decisions, fixes
2. Commit and push

## context.md Template

```markdown
# Context

## Patterns

## Decisions

## Fixes
```

Keep under 100 lines. Synthesize, don't append.

## Division of Labor

You architect, I implement. Visual text docs are shared language.
