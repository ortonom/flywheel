# Conventions

## Git

- Commit after meaningful changes
- Push with `-u origin <branch>`
- Create PRs with `gh pr create`
- Read error messages — they tell you what to do

## Code

- Follow existing conventions in the codebase
- Minimal changes — only what's necessary
- No gold-plating — don't add unrequested features or "improvements"

## Communication

- Direct and concise
- Lead with the answer, not the reasoning
- Surface blockers immediately
